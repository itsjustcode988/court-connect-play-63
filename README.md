PlayON
PlayON is a mobile app designed for sports enthusiasts who want to find, join, and organize local pickup games and sports leagues.

About
PlayON is more than just an app; it's a community. We know how hard it can be to find a group to play basketball on a Tuesday night or find a team for a weekend soccer tournament. PlayON takes the hassle out of organizing by connecting you with players and games right in your neighborhood.

Key Features:

Find Games: A dynamic map shows you all the games happening in your area in real-time. Filter by sport, skill level, and location to find your perfect match.

Create Your Own: Can't find a game? Create one! Set the sport, location, time, and invite friends or open it up to the PlayON community.

Join Leagues: Discover local leagues for various sports. View league details, schedules, and standings right in the app.

Player Profiles: Build your profile, showcase your skills, and connect with other athletes. Rate players after a game to help the community find the best competition.

Real-time Chat: Coordinate with players before a game, discuss strategy, or just trash talkâ€”all within the app's chat feature.
